            I'm a Computer Science student with a deep interest in machine learning, software development, and research. I love exploring the intersection of AI and real-world applications, whether it's building reinforcement learning models or working on text classification and medical research like Parkinson’s disease prediction.
            
            When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me solving LeetCode problems, playing badminton, or diving into a good non-fiction book. I also have a passion for languages—currently learning Spanish and always curious about how different languages shape the way we think.
            
            I believe in constant learning, experimenting with new ideas, and making tech more accessible. Excited to share my journey—let’s connect and create something amazing!
